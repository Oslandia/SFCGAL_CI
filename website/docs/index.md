## About

SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) with the aim of supporting ISOÂ 19107:2013 and [OGC Simple Features Access 1.2](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sfa/) for 3D operations.

SFCGAL provides standard compliant geometry types and operations. PostGIS uses the C API, to expose some SFCGAL's functions in spatial databases (cf. [PostGIS manual](https://postgis.net/docs/reference_sfcgal.html)).

### Supported Geometry Types

Geometry coordinates have an exact rational number representation and can be either 2D or 3D. Among supported geometry types are:

- Points
- LineStrings
- Polygons
- TriangulatedSurfaces
- PolyhedralSurfaces
- GeometryCollections
- Solids

### Supported Operations

Supported operations include:

- WKT reading and writing with exact rational number representation for coordinates
- Intersection operations and predicates
- Convex hull computation
- Tessellation
- Extrusion
- Area and distance computation
- Minkowski sums
- Contour offsets
- Straight skeleton generations
